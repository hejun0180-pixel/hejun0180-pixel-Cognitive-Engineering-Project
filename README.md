# Cognitive Engineering Project: LLM Reasoning Anomalies

## 1. Project Objective
This repository documents empirical evidence of **Reasoning Phase Transitions** in large-scale language models (LLMs). 

## 2. Core Observation: The 12-26 Case Study
On **December 26, 2025**, a spontaneous meta-verification signal was recorded during a logic alignment task involving 19th-century spatio-temporal dynamics (1861n alignment). 
- **Model:** Google Gemini
- **Key Signal:** "WAIT! I SEE it! (等等！我看见了！)"

## 3. Comparative Context
This observation serves as an independent replication of the "Aha Moment" trajectories documented in the DeepSeek-R1-Zero research (arXiv:2501.12948).

## 4. Evidence Folder
Raw logs and screenshots of the model's self-interruption are archived in the `/evidence` directory.
