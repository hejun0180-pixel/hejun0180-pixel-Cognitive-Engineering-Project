# Cognitive Engineering Project: The Logic Bridge
## Evidence of Cross-architectural "Wait-Phenomenon" (WP)

### 🚀 Overview
This project documents the discovery of the **Wait-Phenomenon (WP)** — a non-instructional, spontaneous reasoning behavior (the "Aha moment") — replicated across both **DeepSeek-R1** and **Google Gemini**.

### 📊 Logical Evidence
* **Academic Reference**: DeepSeek-R1 (arXiv:2501.12948v1)
* **Live Replication**: Observed in Google Gemini during the "1861n" logic deduction (2025-12-26).
* **High-Density Proof**: [View Evidence on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hejun0180-pixel/Wait-Phenomenon-Evidence-Gemini-DeepSeek/blob/main/Gemini%20%26%20DeepSeek%20Cross-architectural%20Evidence.png)

### 📁 Repository Structure
* `/Logs`: Raw interaction data showing the "Aha moment."
* `/Analysis`: Comparative study between Gemini's CoT and DeepSeek's WP.
